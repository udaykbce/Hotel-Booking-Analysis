# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
## ðŸ“– Introduction

Analyzing the data of Hotel Booking. This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

We will perform exploratory data analysis with Python to get insight from the data.

Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate?

## ðŸ“– Conclusion

1) City hotels are the most preferred hotel type by the guests. We can say the City Hotel is the busiest hotel.
2) 27.5 % of bookings were got canceled out of all the bookings.
3) Only 3.9 % of people have revisited the hotels. The rest 96.1 % were new guests. Thus retention rate is low.
4) The percentage of 0 changes made in the booking was more than 82 %. The percentage of Single changes made was about 10%.
5) Most of the customers (91.6%) do not require car parking spaces.
6) 79.1 % of bookings were made through TA/TO (travel agents/Tour operators).
7) BB( Bed & Breakfast) is the most preferred type of meal by the guests.
8) Maximum number of guests was from Portugal, i.e. more than 25000 guests.
9) Booking cancellation rate is high for City hotels which is almost 30 %.
10) Waiting time period for City hotels is high as compared to resort hotels. That means city hotels are much busier than Resort hotels.
